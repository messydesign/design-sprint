# Back Burner Board

**Supplies needed:** Whiteboard, Markers

**Estimated time:** 30min for review

## Best to use when

A lot of ideas will be generated throughout the week. Some of the ideas will be pertinent to the tasks at hand, but others, although interesting, won’t be. Capture these good but not immediately relevant back burner ideas on a sticky note board.

## Instructions

1. Have a dedicated space to collect back burner ideas on the whiteboard.
2. Throughout the sprint have everyone write down ideas that are not directly

   solving the job-to-be-done

   and put them up on the whiteboard.

3. As a team during the converge phase,

   review all the ideas that have been put

   up on the wall.

   Trash any that aren't relevant anymore.

4. Record all ideas in a separate document or Trello.
